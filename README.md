## **Beta**: Observable â€“ A JavaScript event system

Observable is a JavaScript mixin for adding observer methods to a function. It's similiar to the jQuery event system, but works with IDs.

**This is beta. I'm still working on the documentation.**

## Usage

You find the source at *lib/observable.js*.

Observable is a mixin. That means it adds a bundle of features to your objects. In this case an event system.

This mixin requires you to copy it deeply.

**Todo: Add a link to a gist, or write a bunch of ways to use mixins.**
